# Algorithms and Test Collection - AnD Fall 2022 ETH
This repository contains all algorithms covered in the course "Algorithms and Datastructures" of the 2022 fall semester at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
It also includes generic interfaces and tests for every algorithm type.

**DISCLAIMER:** This code should not be used in production, this is only a learning source which was created as exam preparation. The algorithms and tests are not optimized for performance nor time or space complexity. You can however use the easy and generic tests to test your own algorithms by implementing the corresponding interface or just use the algorithm implementations to learn them.

**License:** This code is published under the MIT License, so attribution is not required but appreciated when using this code elsewhere.
